## Task 01 : Iris Flower Classification ML Project
Type: Beginner Level Task

This particular ML project is usually referred to as the “Hello World” of Machine Learning. The iris flowers dataset contains numeric attributes, and it is perfect for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms, mainly how to load and handle data. Also, since this is a small dataset, it can easily fit in memory without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities.

## Task 02 : Stock Market Prediction And Forecasting Using Stacked LSTM
Type: Beginner Level Task

Stock values is very valuable but extremely hard to predict correctly for any human being on their own. This task seeks to solve the problem of Stock Prices Prediction by stacked Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), to predict future stock values.

## Task 03 : Prediction using Decision tree
Type: intermediate Level Task
It is a supervised machine learning algorithm, which can be used for both classification as well as regression. In this project, we will be using Decision Trees as a classifier.

The goal of this algorithm is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable, for which the decision tree uses the tree representation to solve the problem. The leaf node corresponds to a class label and attributes are represented on the internal node of the tree.

Leaf node refers to a node with zero children.

Internal nodes refer to nodes with children.
